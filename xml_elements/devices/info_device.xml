  <description>The Info Device manages a collection of data channels describing the 
installation, such a user assigned application name and version. 
Since these channels can be uploaded to Device Cloud, large users can 
use the data for understanding application versions at various sites, and so on.

These data channels are included ONLY if the coorespodning YML setting is not empty:
\t'name'        = a user assigned string, such as "Digi garden management"
\t'version'     = a user assigned string, such as "2.1.A2"
\t'sitename'    = a user assigned string, such as "Golden Valley #2"
\t'comment'     = a user assigned string, such as "Second site to go live"
\t'tags'        = a list as a string, such as "['fff', 'ggg', 23, ]"

These data channels are automatic, so always exist:
\t'build_date'  = a string with date/time created by make.py as dia.zip was built, such "2013-02-06T20:58:45Z"
\t'dia_version' = a string from the core Dia installed, such "2.2.0.1"

The rate is a simple 2-part string of the form "nn tag", where "nn' is an integer and "tag" is a string in ['ms','sec','min','hr','day'], so for example "1 hr" means every 3600 seconds, and so on.</tooltip>
