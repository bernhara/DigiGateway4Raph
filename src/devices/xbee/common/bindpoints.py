Abstract definitions for channels.

Implementation specific details for different protocols live in the
subclasses of XBeeDeviceManager.

These are used for two things:
 1) xbee device driver definitions for extending the ADDRESS_TABLE
    used for device identification in the autoenum driver.

 2) xbee device driver definitions for registering to particular channels
